Quiz Game - OOP JavaScript Practice

## Project Overview
A clean, interactive quiz application built with vanilla JavaScript following Object-Oriented Programming principles. This project demonstrates modern JavaScript techniques and DOM manipulation skills.

## Features
- **Category Selection**: Choose from multiple quiz categories
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty settings
- **Customizable Question Count**: Set how many questions you want to answer
- **Score Tracking**: Real-time score display throughout the quiz
- **Smooth Animations**: Enhanced user experience with AOS (Animate On Scroll) library
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## Technical Implementation
- **OOP Architecture**: Implemented using JavaScript classes for questions, quiz logic, and UI rendering
- **Modern JavaScript**: Utilizes ES6+ features (classes, arrow functions, template literals)
- **Dynamic Content**: Questions and answers are generated dynamically based on user selections
- **API Integration**: Fetches questions from the Open Trivia Database API
